# 3ScaleFuseAMQ


## Story
I'm a developer that's created an integration application consisting of
Multiple services working in combination (let's say single front end with dispatch to two back-ends)
One or more APIs that need to be managed via 3scale
One or more messaging destinations/addresses used for event-driven inputs and outputs
I now want to automate deployment of this application across multiple environments using pre-defined pipelines provided by the platform.  The delivery pipelines must support environment-specific properties, testing, versioning, and the ability to rollback incomplete or failed deployments.
